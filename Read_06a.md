# Creating a basic Javascript!
#### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS.
#### A JavaScript file is a text file (like HTML and CSS files are) but it has .js file extension, so save the file with the name add-content.js
# How to link a Javascript File from an HTML page?
#### When you want to use Javascript with a web page, you use the html <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.
#### Its src attribute tells people where the javascript file is based.
# Placing the script in the page
#### You may see Javascript in the Html between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it better to put scripts in their own files).
