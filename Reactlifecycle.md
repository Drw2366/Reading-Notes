*What types of things can you pass in the props?*

 **allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc. Components cannot change their props - this can only be done externally, as the parent component changes the values passed down.**

*What is the big difference between props and state?*

**state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.*

*When do we re-render our application?*

**whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically.**

*What are some examples of things that we could store in state?*

**You are allowed to store data and components**

**state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.*
