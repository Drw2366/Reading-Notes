# What is an Element?
### An element evaluates into (results in) a single value. 
# There are 2 expressions
### 1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
# var color = 'beige';
### 2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
# var area = 3 * 2;
# Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

# What is a Function?
#### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeation the same set of statements).
# To create a function, you give it a ba==name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is know as a function delclaration.

# Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as calling the function.
