### Javascript distingushes between **numbers**, **strings** and **true** or **false** values known as *Booleans*.
** Data Types **  
### Numeric Data Types   -   (0.75)
### String Data Types    -  (" Hi , Ivy ")
### Boolean Data Types   - (True or False)

# Numeric Data Types
#### Number are not only used for things like calculators; they are also used for task such as determining the size of the screen, moving the position on a page, or setting the amount of time an element should take to fade in.

# String Data Types 
#### The string data types consist of letters and others characters. Strings are enclosed with a pair of quotes. The quotes can be single or double. Strings can be used when working with any kind of text. They are frequently used to add new content into a page and they can contain HTML markup

## Changing the value of a Variable 
#### Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then change what is stored in the variable later in the same script. Once the variable has been created, you don't need to use the var keyword to assign it a new value.

# Arrays
#### An **Array** is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a **list** or a set of values that are * related * to each other.
